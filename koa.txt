**** blacksmith ****
Blacksmithing uses Components to create weapons and armor from Forges.
It should be noted that on easier difficulties, the repair kits practically repair all of an item's durability,
making this skill chiefly about using gems as item fabrication components (level 7).

One other benefit of raising blacksmithing to higher levels, of course, is the ability to craft increasingly specific equipment to suit one's playstyle.
With each new component unlocked, another attribute can be added to a weapon or armor piece, limited in application only by one's supplies of components.

It should also be noted that, by the time one reaches the ability to make "mastercrafted" equipment, an item that one crafts will gain a substantial permanent bonus,
often along the lines of a ~~6% damage or damage reduction increase, even if one unequips the item, re-specifies their skill tree, and equips it again.

1	You can now harvest components from some enemies in the world.
2	You can create an item with three components, giving it a slight bonus.
3	You can salvage infrequent equipment.
4	You can create an item with four components.
6	You can salvage rare equipment.
7	You can use gems as components when crafting equipment.
10	You can create "mastercrafted" equipment.
